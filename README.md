# Privacy Policy for Fapn't

> This privacy policy takes effect the moment you install Fapn't. It may change over time, in which case updates will be shared in changelogs and will take effect when you update the app.

<br>

### Who are we, and what is ALT+F4?

We’re two IT students with big ideas and small budgets. ALT+F4 is the developer account we set up to share apps we build in our spare time. Fapn't is our first app, and while it may seem simple, it took a lot of effort to create. As part of publishing it, we need to explain how we handle your data when you use Fapn't.

<br>

### 1. Information We Collect

Fapn't does not collect, store, or process any personal or non-personal data. Everything happens locally on your device, and the app does not require an internet connection.

<br>

### 2. Third-Party Services and Frameworks

Although Fapn't itself doesn’t collect data, it uses third-party frameworks that may. These include, but are not limited to:  
- Crash reporting and analytics  
- Device and performance metrics  

For example, if you downloaded the app via Google Play, Google may track downloads and usage. These practices are covered by their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing them since we don’t control how third parties handle data.

<br>

### 3. Data Storage and Security

All data generated during app use stays on your device. The security of your device and its data is your responsibility.

<br>

### 4. Children's Privacy

Fapn't is not intended for children under 13. If you’re under 13, please don’t use the app without parental supervision. We do not collect any data, whether from minors or non-minors.

<br>

### 5. Your Rights and Choices

You control all data since it’s stored locally. You can:  
- Clear app data through your device settings  
- Uninstall the app at any time  
- Manage permissions through device settings (though the app works perfectly without any permissions)

<br>

### 6. Monetization and Advertising

Fapn't is free forever. No ads, no in-app purchases, no monetization, and we don’t accept donations.

<br>

### 7. Source Code Availability

We value transparency. The core source code for Fapn't (limited to the `pubspec.yaml` and Dart files, such as the Flutter widgets and pages) is publicly available on GitHub: [HEREPUTTHELINKDUMMY].

Note: The full project, including files like Gradle or XML configurations, is not public due to sensitive informations like developer keys.

<br>

### 8. International Users

Fapn't is available globally. By using it, you consent to the practices described in this privacy policy. It’s your responsibility to ensure the app complies with local laws in your country.

<br>

### 9. Disclaimer of Liability

Using Fapn't is at your own risk. We disclaim liability for damages, losses, or issues arising from its use.

<br>
